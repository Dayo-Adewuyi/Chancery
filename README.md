# CHANCERY

### Problem

The  way courts operates in Nigeria encourages corruption, this has led to a weak justice system that is currently obtainable and lack of faith in the judiciary by the public.

Case Files are constantly stolen/destroyed  by criminals and faux database hack claims are sometimes made by corrupt officials, which is not in tandem with sustainable development goal 16  


### Solution


The solution is CHANCERY, a decentralized file management and workspace for the judiciary. This would enable countries meet the SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16 which is to ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements. 

Chancery allows court cases to be stored in a safe and secured manner by leveraging the use of IPFS, It also enables any member of the public access to closed records in line with the FREEDOM OF INFORMATION law. 

Chancery also enables clerks, registrars, judges and the chief justice perform their various functions without fear or interference. As it provides a secured trail of the various cases from inception till conclusion.



Some of the current features of CHANCERY:

#### THE PUBLIC
- Access to view the court Archives

- Can view all assigned case files
- Can view all assigned exhibits
- Can update the casefile and exhibits
- Can close case after giving judgement

#### THE CLERK
- Cand update case file
- Can update exhibits

### Technologies

- Solidity - The smart contracts is written in solidity
- React.js - The frontend is built with React.js
- IPFS - IPFS is used to store files
- Tenderly - For sending alerts to the discord group when an event is emitted

### Deployments

The smart contract is deployed to FileCoin  Network

### THE CODEBASE

The codebase is divided into two section, the smart contract and front-end. The smart-contract was created using hardhat and front-end with React.js

### HOW TO RUN

```
git clone https://github.com/Dayo-Adewuyi/Chancery

### ROADMAP
- Filtering of closed case files by states/countries.
